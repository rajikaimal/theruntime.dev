[tattooGPT](https://github.com/rajikaimal/tattoo-gpt) is an application where you can quickly generate tattoos based on keywords.
You can go from an idea to a live piece in seconds. All you have to do is, prompt the application
with a few idea keywords and it will give you an image of the tattoo.

ðŸš§ This is a work in progress. I'm planning to add a credit-based auth system and then launch it.
